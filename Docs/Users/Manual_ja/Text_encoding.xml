  <title>Important note for ANSI WinMerge users</title>

  <para>In the ANSI version of WinMerge (WinMerge.exe) that is typically
  installed on older versions of windows, comparisons are set by default to use
  the default Windows ANSI codepages on your system - for example, Windows-1252
  on many Western European systems). If the files you are comparing all use this
  format, the default settings are fine.</para>

  <para>However, if you plan to compare files with different encodings (for
  example, UTF or another Windows codepage), you might need to change the
  default codepage settings, as described in <xref
  linkend="Configuration_codepage" />. If you are running the Unicode version of
  WinMerge (WinMergeU.exe), comparisons handle different encodings
  transparently, and so codepage settings do not affect you.</para>
